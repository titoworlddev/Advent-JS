# 🎅🏼🎄 Advent-JS 🎄🎅

This is a project showing my solutions used to complete midudev's [advent.js](https://adventjs.dev/es) website challenge.

Here I have learned a lot about **JavaScript** and I have greatly improved my programming logic.

Glad to have participated and thanks to [midudev](https://github.com/midudev) for doing this kind of thing for the community.
